# Basic-Cyber-Projects-with-Python

This repository contains simple Python projects related to cybersecurity. Each project is designed to help you understand fundamental cybersecurity concepts and practices. Below is a brief description of each project.

Projects
1.Brute-Force Attack
File: Brute-Force Attack.py

This project simulates a brute-force attack on a simple password. It generates possible combinations of characters and attempts to guess the correct password by comparing each generated combination with the target password.

Key Concepts:

Brute-force attacks
Password security
Time complexity


2. File Integrity Checker
File: File Integrity Checker.py

This script verifies the integrity of a file by generating its hash and comparing it with an expected hash value. It's useful for detecting file tampering or corruption.

Key Concepts:

File integrity
Hash functions
Data security


3. Password Generator
File: Password Generator.py

This project generates secure, random passwords based on user-specified criteria, including length and the inclusion of numbers, uppercase letters, and special characters.

Key Concepts:

Password security
Randomization
User input handling


4. Password Strength Checker
File: Password Strength Checker.py

This script evaluates the strength of a password based on length, complexity, and the use of special characters. It helps users understand the importance of creating strong, secure passwords.

Key Concepts:

Password strength evaluation
Regular expressions
Security best practices


5. Port Scanner
File: Port Scanner.py

This project is a basic port scanner that checks for open ports on a specified IP address. It helps you understand how network scanning works and the importance of securing open ports.

Key Concepts:

Network security
Port scanning
Socket programming


How to Run These Projects

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-cyber-projects.git

cd python-cyber-projects

Install Dependencies:

These projects primarily use Python's standard libraries, so no additional dependencies are required. However, for the keylogger project or any other projects requiring third-party libraries, you can install them using pip.

Run a Project:
python filename.py

Replace filename.py with the name of the Python file you want to run, such as Password Generator.py.
